# Portfolio of Berdakh

The portfolio consists of 4 main sections. Short descriptions are written as not technical as possible. If you want to read the technical description, navigate to the Github page of the app. There you can find the full technical description, tech stack, commits I made with the timestamp, full source code, and demo app that you can use.
